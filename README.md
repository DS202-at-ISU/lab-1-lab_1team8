# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

12.3) Moderate difficulty, I had to download Git and link it to my
RStudio

12.4) Only trouble was authentication error. Many people seemed to
struggle with this.

12.5) Had to figure out merging and making sure all versions are the
same before we could push and pull.

More struggles - 1) I had issues configuring to git beyond the user and
password config lines so I talked to the instructor and made a
supertoken to get access.

2)  We had to coordinate when to pull or push to make sure that we have
    the most updated version of the file.

3)  We had to figure out which file to edit because the textbook said
    the md file whereas the class slides said Rmd. Eventually we
    realized the difference and used the Rmd.

4)  Making sure to submit with the true url instead of the one github
    provides is something to keep in mind. \>\>\>\>\>\>\>
