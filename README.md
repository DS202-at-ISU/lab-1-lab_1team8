# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

1.  Getting the key authentication was a struggle to get into. We could
    not figure out what email address or username to input.  
2.  Downloading git correctly was a challenge to make sure the we had it
    correctly installed.  
3.  Figuring out the process of pushing a pulling was overcome through
    trial and error.  
4.  Attaching our team respository to Rstudio was as struggle. It was a
    challenge to figure out which file to edit and how to correctly
    commit messages.  
5.  It is important to ensure merging is complete. If not you can solve
    the problem with abort command.
